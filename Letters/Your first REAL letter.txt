Crossing my fingers it works. Idk how it's gonna look compared to your pretty letters, sooooooo we'll find out.</div><div><br></div><div>Lemme tell ya about my week!</div><div><br></div><div>So. Monday we talkedddd and I took my PE final. I got a 79.5/84 and my total grade was 99.37%</div><div><br></div><div>Tuesday, I took my math final and got an 81.5/100. Total g<div style="text-align: center;"><div style="text-align: right;"></div></div>rade was 91.8%, A-.</div><div><br></div><div>Wednesday, I worked until 7 and then wrote as much as my paper as I could, however I got quite distracted a few times.</div><div><br></div><div>Thursday, I woke up early and was writing downstairs by 10am. Got distracted several times per usual but managed to get it done with 30 minutes to spare! I got 100/100 (don't ask me how) and finished with an 89.82%. A B+. Then I ran to Deseret Book and browsed alllll the books on the shelves. I was then going to run to target to find something for Brynn for her birthday but didn't feel like going in. But I wanted to go to Trader Joes! Mother wanted to come but she was watching Isaac wrestle (he's on the team). I didn't know that she still wanted to come, so Eli willingly came with me. On the way there, she called me telling me that she would come with me after he finished wrestling. This call happened as we were about to pass Maceys in Orem, so Eli and I stopped there, walked around, grabbed a donut, and drove back home just in time for mother to pull up. Then the three of us went to Trader Joes. And of course, because Costco thinks they're elite and changed their policy for anyone who steps foot in there, I made us go because mother was with me! We wandered around for an hour and Eli was basically being tortured. Because there was no list, I just wanted to walk around my favorite store. AND you can't go to Costco and not get a slice of pizza. Favorite pizza ever. The only kind I crave (keep that in mind).</div><div><br></div><div>Friday, I had work until 5 and then idk what I did. I think nothing. I was still quite sick at this point so I had no energy to do anything on my list.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>Saturday, I had work again and it on and off snowed the whole shift. Friday night at 1am was when I had been coughing for an hour and I took that horrible liquid that makes you not cough and it helps you sleep! My alarm was set for 7:30am however the sound didn't go off (it sometimes does that and I think it's cause my phone was on silent mode) so I naturally woke up at 8:50. So I jumped out of bed and got my hair in a ponytail and BAM. Bloody nose. Basically everywhere. It was like I had been stabbed 100 times. Aaaaaand then it wouldn't stop. For about 15 minutes. So I texted Nethania and told her I'd be late. Soooo I didn't show up to work until 9:20. I wore sweats and sounded and looked awful, but at least I made it. So. That was nice. Then, when I got home, I had the house to myself and naturally watched and fell asleep to a Christmas movie. I was so comfortable and cozy, I couldn't help myself. I woke up to father watching his TV show. I moseyed around until mother left for her shift at the temple and then took over her room and started watching another Christmas movie on her couch. It was boring so I turned on Gilmore Girls and Eli and I watched that and ate Ramen together. OH! I know what I did. I went and got soup dumplings and popsicles! I was craving both of those. Didn't cook the dumplings long enough and the pork was still kinda raw, sooooo I ended up just throwing it away because I didn't feel like cooking them longer. That's when I made Ramen instead. Thennnnnn I went to sleep. and that takes us to today!</div><div><br></div><div>It was the first day I didn't have to wake up early and I coulda gotten up and ready for church, buuuuut I didn't. Well. I didn't set an alarm and I woke up at 10am and church was at 10:30 and I needed to shower, and rushing or being late didn't sound exciting. So then I took lots of drugs before going to the Wrights to make gingerbread houses for Brynn's birthday!!! I've been on antibiotics the past few days and I'm not fevered; I just have this horrible cough that won't go away! And just tired and low energy, but I can't do nothing forever and ever!&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>Soooooo that's it! That's my week. That was a lot. Sorry.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>Now. Onto you. How are you? How are those poor old man knees? Is the ibuprofen helping? If it isn't, mayyyyyybe don't take it so frequently. It's not the greatest drug to take long term and can be hard on your kidneys and stomach, especially if you aren't taking it with food. So, just be careful. Is there anything I can do for you?&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>Did you know I love you? Like an incredibly large amount.&nbsp;</div><div>These letters have been my favorite thing you've done for me on your mission, so thank you. For having an idea and making it happen. I've been missing you a lot lately. I just wanna tell you to come home and I'll probably tell you that many more times throughout the next 5 months. Just come home! Your knees will automatically be cured, I know it ;)</div><div>Anywaysssssss, thank you for loving me. And for finding ways to show your love for me from 900 miles away. You're the cutest person ever and I'm completely obsessed with you. Ya know how I was like, "maybe we shouldn't get married in 2025." ALLLLLLLL I'M THINKING ABOUT IS MARRYING YOU!!!!! Ugh. So lame. I think I just wanna spend time with you and marrying you would mean I could spend 24/7 with you! I have a feeling we'll be spending just about that much time together when you get home and up until we get married.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>Reagan mentioned something about your parents hiking the Grand Canyon together during their "hiking adventure" when they met, and I told them how I wanted to hike rim to rim and float down the river and camp!!! She goes, "yes! I've been wanting to go back! Let's do it!" So. Now we're doing that, and you're being dragged along.&nbsp;</div><div>And then we talked about, "whoever marries porter *wink wink wink* is going to have children who will be shorter than us." Hey. At least they'll get to cuddle little tiny 6oz babies. Plus, tall people don't live as long. Also, I think our kids will be about our height, unless some bizarre incident occurs where they're like 6ft tall.&nbsp;</div><div>Ughhhhhhh I'm dying here Porter. We're so freakin close but so freakin far. I wanna bury myself alive. Actually. Put me in a coma until you come home. Then you can be the one to reintroduce me into the world. This sucks. I'm starting to feel like when you first left. A slow slow death. Idk how I'm going to do really well on these next 7 classes. That's two more than this semester and we'll be reaching 4 months when I begin school! Like will I not be completely distracted thinking about you when there's two months, or even one month left??? Classes end April 30th, but with my student teaching for the last 3 weeks of the semester, idk if that means I'll be teaching in May or April?? Cause if classes end April 30th, THE TWO WEEK COUNTDOWN IS GONNA BE PURE TORTURE CAUSE I'LL JUST BE WORKING! Okay. I'm done. It's so easy to get sidetracked and think about this.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>I love you. You're my best friend. I miss you. Have any advice? You're all I think about. I wanna marry you. And do every fun thing with you.&nbsp;</div><div>You're just perfect. Idk what else to say! Everything about you is just. Chefs kiss.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>HAHA! Oh! I learned that you're grandma Haley has favorites and it seems like it's always been Keegan (aside from the newborns) and then you and then Morley. Apparently she likes the adult male grandkids the most. So. It's nice to know I'm marrying the second best grandkid ;)</div><div><br></div><div>I'll talk to you tomorrow okay babe?? I just wanna kiss your face alllll the live long day!!!!</div><div><br></div><div>You're the love of my life. I love you I love you I love you.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>Love,</div><div>Mare</div>
